# Personal-Portfolio

## Description

I created a professional portfolio for future possible employers to view. My portfolio tells them a little about myself, a showcase of projects I've worked on, and links to contact me directly, or direct them to my Github and LinkedIn profile. My motivation behind this project was to build a unique and well designed webpage to demonstrate what I have learned and will continue to learn as a web developer. It allows me to reach possible employers and help me stand out in the crowd to help me along my journey in this new career. Building this application has taught me many useful CSS skills, helped grow my knowledge of webpage layout and using flexbox, aswell as growing my knowlege of media querys and adapting a responsive design in my applications. This will be very helpful going forward for better mobile optimization and responsive designs, aswell as more complex yet well designed webpages.
